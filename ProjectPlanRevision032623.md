Project Plan

Revised on 3/26/23: Due to the page will not be published yet, so testing Page Speeds will be challenging. Other features were added to replace the speed test. 

Project Brief

My project will be a portfolio website to advertise my skills to potential employers. The website will contain the following sections: My Story, Skills, Projects, Education, Work Experience, Contact Me. It will all be comprised of one page, with a navigation menu at the top. The site will include two media queries that will enable the site to display on different sized viewports (tablet and desktop), thereby providing a better user experience. The media queries will use CSS Flexbox. The website will be designed as mobile first principles. All the work for the project will be completed by me. 
I will use an HTML file for the content, a CSS file for the content styling, and a Javascript file an array and animating the hamburger menu. Features that my site will include are:
- A responsive menu, using CSS and Javascript, that includes use of a hamburger menu for mobile devices that expands to buttons on tablet and desktop viewports.
- Transition animation(s) will be used for the navigation elements of the page on hover. Also transition animation for the email and social media links.
- A hide and show using CSS for the navigation div, so that in the mobile and table views, clicking the hamburger will bring up the full menu.
- An accordion will be created, using Javascript and CSS, to display the different sections of the portfolio page.
- Create and populate a Javascript array of my skills that will display in a section of the page.
